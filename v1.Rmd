This is a talk about context. So let's give you some.

I'm Alex, a former future linguist.  What is that?  Back in 2010, I started a phd program linguistics. For while there, I was a future linguist, studying the semantics of modality in English.  I am no longer a future linguist...but I'm not a linguist either.  I left grad school after two years and since then, I've had various data jobs in the Bay Area.

I only studied linguistics for 2 years, but my other qualification for this talk, is like most of you: I am "native speaker" of data visualization.

Over the years, I've made a lot of charts. I've also read a lot more charts.  Drawn conclusions, changed my mind. A thing I also have a lot of experience with: Making a chart that convinces me of something. Then sharing the chart with somebody in hopes of convincing them. And they are not convinced!

Descriptivism: How people actually use language
Prescriptivism: How some asshole thinks people should use language

How to be a better prescriptivist:

One word can have two meanings.
Two words can overlap in meaning.
It's okay to have personal preferences about how you use language.  It's not okay to criticize others for having different personal preferences.
When this happens in language: it ends up being racist and classist.


There is a lot of different language out there.

Bits of pragmatics:

- Pronoun Resolution
- Vagueness and Ambiguity
- Speech Acts
- Social meaning

Phonetics - how humans produce and process speech as sounds (or gestures).
Phonology - abstract represantions "sounds" and how they combine with languages.
Morphology - study of structure within words: -ed
Syntax - How words combine to make sentences
Semantics - How the meaning of words combines to determine the meaning of sentences
Pragmatics - How the context impacts the meaning of sentences

All these subfields interact in complicated ways, and cutting across all these subfields, linguists work with various (Computational, Phsycho-, Socio-) and various languages.

A few points about data visualization here:

- Charts also have this multilevel compositional nature:
Data (which has its own compositional nature) is mapped to pixels or some other physical material. But we can analyze charts abstracted away from the physical material. When I think about charts, I don't think in pixels, I think in geoms.

Data visualization is fundamentally compositional. Pixels make dots, lines, regions.  Labels, titles, Small multiples, reports.  The meaning of a chart is not just the meaning of the pieces, but in how they are composed.

There's room to study the perceptual aspects of data visualization.
There's room to study artificial intelligence.
There's room to use introspection, philosophy, pure math
There's room for prescriptivism, just know you're doing it.

Think about this shit from every angle we can.  Welcome interdisciplinary analysis.  Study the charts in the wild, marvel at them. Have empathy for people's ongoing struggle to communicate. A lot of "prescriptivism" in data viz really comes down to

But it's more complicated:

- Nobody is actually a native speaker of viz...although vis relies on natural cognitives processes that power communication.
- Data visualization is rarely in the canonical 2-speaker situation that linguists are most comfortable.
- Most chart utterances are also super complex. We reach to charts to express things that words alone fail.
- Grice's maxims are a little flimsy as a predictive tools.
- Your generalization about language will fall apart based on some data point.

Lawyers
Journalists

Ways Data Viz as a field of study is like linguistics.

- It's young...but also has a long legacy.


Quality - You gotta believe what you're trying to convey!!!
Relevance - You gotta believe what you're saying will help your interlocutor know something.
Quantity - Show enough data, don't show too much data.
Manner - respect the conventions of your audience.

"In one chart"

One of the projects I'm working on right now is a customer reporting initiative. There's more than one report type.

Trust:

When I'm talking to my boss, I don't have to do as much with a chart to establish trust.

Somebody who's job I only kind of understand

I'm making a chart factory.
Each customer has a different dataset.
There are also start date end date parameters.

Be Relevant

Quality

A key word is “believe”.

The level of evidence needed is depends on the situation.

Phonetics has to do with the physical properties of language: things like how the position of your tongue affects the sounds you make, and how those sounds are perceived by the listener.
Phonology deals with the mental representations of those sounds, and how they behave across and within languages.
Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words: -ed, to indicate past tense is a textbook morpheme.
Syntax: how words are structured into sentences. Most closely maps onto parts of speech.
Semantics: how the meaning of words in a particular structure determine the meaning of sentences.
Pragmatics: how the context in which a sentence was uttered determines its meaning.

It depends.

It depends on your audience.
It depends on your data.
It depends on the medium through which you're communicating.
