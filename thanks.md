A great number of things needed to happen in order for me to give this talk today.

Josh Sabloff, my college math professor, who taught me how much easier it is to undestand complex ideas when you have colored pencils within arm's reach.

My mother, for lugging a heavy introductory linguistics in her suitcase several years ago despite my reason being "I've got this idea".

I actaully stole said textbook from an office-mate's desk on my last day before leaving grad school. I'm sorry, but I'd do it again.

And everyone in Ohio State University's Linguistics Department who contributed to said textbook, which is called Language Files.  Any pieces of this talk that make sense were probably cribbed from there.

Craige Roberts, my pragmatics professor, and graduate advisor.  She'll probably rip this talk to shreds.

Carl Pollard, another one my advisors in grad school, whose Formal Foundations in Linguistics course gave me a technical foundation for some much for than Linguistics.

The student who copied that homework assignment, and academic panel who I failed to persuade of said copying, for giving me a truly authentic teaching experience. I don't remember your name, student, but who knows where I would have ended up without your "help".

And all my other colleagues from OSU's Ling department.

I'm a little late to Scott McCloud party, but Understanding Comics has really raised my thinking about communicating data over the last year. Another inspiring comic I read was Hope Larson's *All Summer Long*, a very sweet book about honing your craft and finding your people.

Scott Murray, for creating and maintain vis.social. It's a weird little community, but

Hadley Wickham, steward of the Tidyverse, and everyone else working on open source R tools and especially everyone working to make its community so special. Special shoutout to my ggplot heros: Thomas Lin Peterson, Bob Rudis, Kieran Healy, TJ Mahr, and Kent Russell. And Yihui Xie, who has helped make some of the incredible tools for communicating data, and whose honest and vulnerable writing on his [career crisis](https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/career-crisis/) has served me as an excellent pep talk more than once.

Bjorn and everyone else I worked with at Toca Boca, for always humoring me when I wanted to get a little too creative with my charts.

Everyone on the PeopleDev M&E team, especially Aruna and Wantana.

Danny and Rebecca at Hack Reactor, for challenging me not just to be a better engineer, but to be a better teammate and a better communicator.

Reenuka, a classmate at Hack Reactor, who endorsed me on Linkedin for public speaking.

Everyone at Bugcrowd, especially Mike for the assist on writing up my short description of this talk.

Robert and Ben and Eveyln, and everyone else who made Tapestry happen, for inviting me and putting on such a great conference.

I'll thank my mom once more, as well as the rest of my family. For all the support and encouragement.

I also want to thank all my Hebrew School teachers and my Bar Mitzvah tutors. Anytime I speak in front of a crowd, I feel like a squeaky voiced thirteen year old nervously trying to get through my haftorah portion.


Mark Liberman, from the website LanguageLog. I don't know that I would have found my way into linguistics without your amazing work.  Mark is also one of the most inspiring data analysts I've ever come across.

People I've never met that made this talk possible:


* Shirley Wu for making the amazing Twitch talk show #ShirleyChats.  It's like a podcast you can see!  I discovered it on a Sunday in January, where Shirley and Tony Chu were chatting Javascript and data visualization.
