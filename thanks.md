A great number of things needed to happen in order for me to give this talk today.

Josh Sabloff, my college math professor, who taught me how much easier it is to undestand complex ideas when you have colored pencils within arms reach.

My mother, for lugging a heavy introductory linguistics in her suitcase several years ago despite my reason being "I've got this idea".

I actaully stole said textbook from an office-mate's desk on my last day before leaving grad school. I'm sorry, but I'd do it again.

And everyone in Ohio State University's Linguistics Department who contributed to said textbook, which is called Language Files.  Any pieces of this talk that make sense were probably cribbed from there.

Craige Roberts, my pragmatics professor, and graduate advisor. She'll probably rip this talk to shreds.

Carl Pollard, another one my advisors in grad school, whose formal frameworks 

The student who I'm still convinced copied that homework assignment, and academic panel who I failed to persuade of said copying, for giving me a truly authentic teaching experience. I don't remember your name, student, but who knows where I would have ended up without your "help".

And all my other colleagues from OSU's Ling department.

Scott Murray, for keeping the lights on at vis.social.

Hadley Wickham, steward of the Tidyverse, and everyone else working on open source R work and its community.

Danny and Rebecca at Hack Reactor, for challenging me not just to be a better engineer, but to be a better teammate and a better communicator.

Reenuka, a classmate at Hack Reactor, who endorsed me on linkedin for public speaking.

Everyone at Bugcrowd, especially Mike for the assist on writing up my short description of this talk.

Robert, and everyone else at Tableau for inviting me and putting on such a great conference. Evelyn, who handled some of the logistics.
