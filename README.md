This is a messy-ass repo containing most of the work for my 2018-11-30 talk at the Tapestry Conference titled "Charts as Utterances"

The slides themselves were made using Google presentations are are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yOmkpES3IZB__sJqLT1yILWuN3ErixUDhg0NZ9O48OY).
